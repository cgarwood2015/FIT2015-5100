Program Development using Top-down design, Stepwise refinement
==============================================================

Program function 
================
Determine the balance of customers of a store based on a number of
factors and also determine if the customers have exceeded their credit 
limits.
                  
Redefinement Step 1
===================
Initialize variables
Input and calculate balance of credit
Output the balance and output of the user credit limit is exceed.

Redefinement Step 2 - Initialize variables
==========================================
Initialize account = 0.00
Initialize beg_balance = 0.00
Initialize mthly_total_charges=0.00
Initialize mthly_total_credit=0.00
Initialize credit_allowed=0.00
Initialize end_balance=0.00
Initialize excess_credit=0.00

Redefinement Step 3 - Input and calculate balance of credit
===========================================================
Prompt the user to enter customer account number
Input the first account number  => Possible sentinel value
While the value not sentinel value
	Prompt the user to enter beginning balance
	Input and assign value entered to beg_balance
	
	Prompt the user to enter Total items charged for the month
	Input and assign value to mthly_total_charges
	
	Prompt the user to enter Total credit applied to the customers account this month
	Input and assign value to mthly_total_credit
	
	Prompt the user to enter Total credit applied to the customers account this month
	Input and assign value to mthly_total_credit
	
	Prompt the user to enter customer's credit limited
	Input and assign value to credit_allowed
	
	Add Beginning Balance to monthly charges and subtract total credit applied to customer
	and assign to the end balance.
	
	Substract end balance from credit allowed and assigned to excess_credit  
	
	Prompt the user to enter customer account number
	Input the account number  => Possible sentinel value


Redefinement Step 4 - Output the balance and output of the user credit limit is exceed.
=======================================================================================
Print end balance

if excress_credit is less than zero
	Print credit limit exceeded
